INFS 611 FINAL PROJECT - Sensor Scan Application

A comprehensive mobile application designed to detect falls using smartphone sensors. The app leverages the Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer, and GPS to monitor user activity and trigger alerts when a fall is detected. The application also allows users to manually trigger an emergency alert with a button click.

Features
	•	Fall Detection:
	•	Uses sensor data to detect sudden movements characteristic of a fall.
	•	Sends an emergency alert with the user’s current location if a fall is detected.
	•	Emergency SOS:
	•	Allows users to manually trigger an SOS alert with a single button click.
	•	Sensor Integration:
	•	Reads data from the following sensors:
	•	Accelerometer: Measures motion and tilt.
	•	Gyroscope: Tracks angular velocity for orientation.
	•	Magnetometer: Provides compass functionality.
	•	GPS: Fetches the user’s location for alerts.
	•	Customizable Contacts:
	•	Users can add, edit, or remove emergency contacts.
	•	Alerts are sent to predefined contacts with a personalized message.
	•	User-Friendly Interface:
	•	Real-time display of sensor data.
	•	Visual indicators for compass and device orientation.

How It Works
	1.	The app continuously monitors accelerometer and gyroscope data.
	2.	When a fall-like event is detected:
	    •	The app sends an SOS alert to emergency contacts, including:
	    •	The user’s location (latitude and longitude).
	    •	Sensor readings during the fall.
	3.	Users can also manually send an alert by pressing the SOS button.

Technologies Used
	•	Flutter: Front-end framework for building the app.
	•	Sensors Plus: Library for accessing accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data.
	•	Geolocator: Library for GPS location tracking.
	•	Permission Handler: For managing runtime permissions.
	•	Map Launcher: To open map applications for location visualization.

Usage
	•	Set Up Emergency Contacts:
	•	Open the app and add emergency contacts.
	•	Customize the alert message as needed.
	•	Test Fall Detection:
	•	Simulate a fall-like movement to trigger the detection mechanism.
	•	Manual SOS:
	•	Press the SOS button to immediately send alerts to contacts.
